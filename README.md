# Credit Card Fruad Detection

# Objective:
The goal is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression,
on a highly imbalanced dataset.

# Steps Taken:

# Data Exploration:

Checked for missing values.
Explored statistical measures (mean, min, max) for both normal and fraudulent transactions.
# Data Preprocessing:

Balanced the dataset using undersampling.
#Modeling:

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using stratified sampling.
Trained a logistic regression model on the balanced dataset.
# Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's accuracy on both training and testing datasets.
Achieved an accuracy of approximately 90.36% on the testing data.
# Conclusion:
The logistic regression model showed promising results in detecting fraudulent transactions with a high degree of accuracy.
Further improvements could involve exploring other algorithms, handling imbalanced datasets using other techniques like 
oversampling or more advanced ensemble methods.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in real-world scenarios like fraud detection, where data
preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation are crucial for effective implementation.
